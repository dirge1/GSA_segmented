If you want to get the result of Fig.1 directly by our provided results, you can run Fig1_picture_varyU_withbar.m in run_main.

If you want to get the result of Fig.1 on your own computer, you can run main_fire.m in run_main. It should be noted that **python environment must be configured in Matlab**. 

You can configure the python environment in Matlab by following the video released by the author (in Chinese): https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1xp421Z7Ua/?vd_source=a1dbb3ff5999b954fed0a1a5c93cd04b.

We use the python package ennemi, chaospy (not used but needed) and SALib. The details and references are provided in the paper.
